## Objective
- Topic: Water Potability
- Motivation: To find baseline for water quality
- Target Audience: Public and Individual Use
- Value Proposition: Central Water Potability Testing Website

## Source Data 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability

## Pipeline / Software
- Data Model Implementation: Jupyter notebook, Plotly, Heatmap
- Data Model Optimization: Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with Resampled Data, Random Forest, K-Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, XGboost Classifier
- Application/Website: HTML, Javascript, Flask

## Model Exploration
- Logistic Regression: 60% Accuracy


- Logistic regression with resampled data: 52% Accuracy


- Random forest: 67% Accuracy


- K-Neighbors: 69% Accuracy


- XGboost classifier: 61% Accuracy


- Support Vector Machine Model: 71% Accuracy



## Challenges

- Dataset: Debating using larger data set to increase accuracy 
- Model Accuracy: Achieving an optimization score of at least 75%
- Flask App/Website: Populating input data results reliably 
- User Interface: Implementing website functionality

## Next Steps

- Data Quality: Increase data range to increase accuracy
- Website Features: Comparison per location, warning system if variable levels are close to unsafe
- Testing Equipment: Pair this model with scalable mobile test kits for individual use


## Summary

- In conclusion, we have created a predictive machine learning model to test for water potability. This model can be paired with mobile testing equipment for individual assessment of new water samples.
