## Pipeline / Software
- Data Model Implementation: Jupyter notebook, Plotly, Heatmap
- Data Model Optimization: Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with Resampled Data, Random Forest, K-Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, XGboost Classifier
- Application/Website: HTML, Javascript, Flask

## Model Exploration
- Logistic Regression: 60% Accuracy
- Logistic regression with resampled data: 52% Accuracy
- Random forest: 67% Accuracy
- K-Neighbors: 69% Accuracy
- XGboost classifier: 61% Accuracy
- Support Vector Machine Model: 71% Accuracy

## Challenges

- Dataset: Debating using larger data set to increase accuracy 
- Model Accuracy: Achieving an optimization score of at least 75%
- Flask App/Website: Populating input data results reliably 
- User Interface: Implementing website functionality

## Next Steps

- Data Quality: Increase data range to increase accuracy
- Website Features: Comparison per location, warning system if variable levels are close to unsafe
- Testing Equipment: Pair this model with scalable mobile test kits for individual use


## Summary

- In conclusion, we have created a predictive machine learning model and website to test for water potability. This model can be paired with mobile testing equipment for individual assessment of new water samples.
