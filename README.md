# Water_Quality_Model

## Summary

For our project, we would like to create a predictive model for scientists and city officials monitoring and maintaining baseline drinking water standards. This model can be paired with scalable testing equipment for continual testing of new water samples by both civilians and officials.

## Objective
- Topic: Water Quality
- Motivation: Predict water drinkability 
- Target Audience: Civilians and Officials 
- Value Proposition: Standardized, scalable model for water testing
- Next Steps: Build scaled testing equipment for both civilians and officials
Test kits for a backpack, or an entire city
